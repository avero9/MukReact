                        <p>Being one of the first 151 Pokemon, Muk has had its fair number of apparitions in all things Pokemon related: the official games, the anime, the trading card game (TGC), plushies and so on.
                        On this site I decided to focus on its appearances in the TCG, by showing the world the many ways Muk has been interpreted by various artist throughout the years.</p>
